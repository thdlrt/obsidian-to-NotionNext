# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## 2.8.7 (2026-03-19)

### Fixed

- Added table-safe attachment rewrite mode: attachment references inside markdown table rows are downgraded to plain text to avoid breaking table column structure.
- Reduced Notion `Number of cells in table row must match the table width` validation failures caused by attachment placeholders/newlines in table cells.

## 2.8.6 (2026-03-19)

### Fixed

- Improved failed attachment fallback: when local/external attachment upload is skipped or fails, the reference is now replaced with plain filename text to keep markdown structure stable.
- Prevented table structure breakage caused by unresolved attachment syntax in complex content (e.g., table cells), reducing Notion `table width` validation errors.

## 2.8.5 (2026-03-19)

### Fixed

- Improved attachment upload robustness: oversized local files (>5MB) are skipped with warnings instead of producing noisy upload errors, so note sync can continue.
- Improved markdown image rewrite fallback for list-prefixed image syntax and rich-text link forms, reducing missing images for cases like `- ![image](url)`.

## 2.8.4 (2026-03-04)

### Fixed

- Fixed version bump with `tag-version-prefix="v"` in `.npmrc` causing incorrect version format in `package.json` (e.g. `v2.8.1` instead of `2.8.1`)

## 2.8.1 (2026-03-04)

### Added

- **Auto-sync success notice setting**: Toggle whether to show success notifications for auto-sync (defaults to off)

### Changed

- Auto-sync is quieter by default: success and "start upload" notices are suppressed unless explicitly enabled

### Fixed

- Auto-sync no longer shows "All blocks has been uploaded" (`BlockUploaded`) notice when success notices are disabled
